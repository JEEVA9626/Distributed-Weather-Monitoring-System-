Distributed Weather Monitoring System

A web-based application that displays real-time weather data for multiple cities.

Features
- Displays current temperature and humidity for each city
- Updates weather data every 10 minutes
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data

Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-monitoring-system.git`
2. Replace `YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key in `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser

How it Works
1. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data for each city.
2. The `updateWeatherData` function is called every 10 minutes to update the weather data on the page.
3. The temperature and humidity values are displayed for each city.

Requirements
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up for free at https://openweathermap.org/)

Future Development
- Add more cities to the monitoring system
- Display additional weather data, such as wind speed and precipitation
- Improve the user interface and design
